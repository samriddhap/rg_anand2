			<p>Anand wrote plays in Hindi or Urdu-Hindi (Hindustani, as it was commonly known at the time, and Farsi) with crisp, lively dialogue and believable characters, directed with flair, getting the best out of his cast (some of his plays involved large casts of as many as thirty performers), innovated with stage design, and made untiring efforts to professionalize theatre, as well as to establish a quality auditorium for the staging of drama. A hallmark of RG as a theatre man was his attention to detail. </p><p>His endeavour was to focus equally on all aspects of drama, from script writing to lyrics and music, from dialogues to diction, from stage design and props to costumes, from acting to dances. This was what lay behind his impulse and ability to attract a range of talented people – lyricists, singers, designers and other artists – as collaborators to the Delhi stage.  </p>
			<p>Comedy was his forte, and while his underlying themes were always serious, imbued with a deep social concern, he had no qualms about incorporating song and dance and other popular elements in a play to increase its appeal.</p><p> RG himself made no bones about the nature of the theatre he produced – it was popular entertainment, and there was no pretence of writing or producing literary or avant-garde drama. His motivation was purely to attract an audience for theatre and to do what he loved. There could have been no commercial incentive since, far from earning any money from his plays, he was putting his own money into them! And perhaps this kind of theatre was exactly what was required during the period. </p>

			<span>Vivah Bandhan on Queensway  </span>
			<hr>
			<p>RG’s first play, Vivah Bandhan, was performed on a stage erected in a restaurant, Metro, on Queensway (now Janpath). </p>
			<p>The lack of venues to stage plays was one of numerous difficulties plaguing theatre of the time. In the 1950s Delhi had only the open-air Wavell Theatre at Janpath (which had to be equipped with folding chairs and covered with a marquee for performances), Sapru House and the Fine Arts Theatre which charged prohibitive rents, and a small 150-seater hall at YMCA. </p><p>‘Alternatively one had to hire Dining Halls of Metro Restaurant … or Standard Restaurant (then known as Davico) and convert them to make-believe Theatre Halls; but worst of all was the cajoling, blackmailing, pleading and promising one had to do in order to sell a few tickets, if only to cover some of the basic expenses, and gather a sprinkling of an audience for the shows.</p>

			<hr>
			<p>RG’s daughter Priyamvada Kapur reminiscences: ‘At around five, after work, people would start trickling in and rehearsals would begin. It was one big mela every evening! On days before the actual show, rehearsals would go on all day, with lunch being served in the garden. So much hustle and bustle, actors fluffing their lines and everyone bursting out in laughter… It was such fun for us kids to watch! Passersby often stopped to watch as well, and they were served tea and snacks too.’ She recalls her mother Romeshlatta being very supportive of father’s passion, uncomplainingly taking care of things that needed to be done.</p>
			<p> ‘Only occasionally would she mildly voice objections to the money being spent on the endless rounds of tea!’ </p>
